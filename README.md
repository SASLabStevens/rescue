# rescue

An observer-based algorithm for resilient consensus and cooperation (formation) over time-varying networks, subject to intermittent connections and a worst-case number of non-cooperative (adversarial) agents.

The resilience of a time-varying network G against a worst-case number of adversarial agents is characterized by the graph (network) algebraic connectivity in an integral sense that is defined as (\mu, T)-Persistency-of-Excitation connectivity.
